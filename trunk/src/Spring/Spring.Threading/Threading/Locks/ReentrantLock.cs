{
	/// <summary> 
	/// A reentrant mutual exclusion <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ILock"/> with the same basic
	/// behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
	/// <see lang="lock"/> statements, but with extended
	/// capabilities.
	/// 
	/// <p/> 
	/// A <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock"/> is <b>owned</b> by the thread last
	/// successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
	/// <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.Lock()"/> will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
	/// the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
	/// immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
	/// be checked using methods <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.HeldByCurrentThread"/>, and 
	/// <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.HoldCount"/>.
	/// 
	/// <p/> The constructor for this class accepts an optional
	/// <b>fairness</b> parameter.  When set <see lang="true"/>, under
	/// contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
	/// thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
	/// access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
	/// may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
	/// slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
	/// variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
	/// starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
	/// fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
	/// fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
	/// active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
	/// lock.
    /// Also note that the untimed <see cref="M:Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.TryLock"/> method does not
	/// honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
	/// is available even if other threads are waiting.
	/// 
	/// <p/> 
	/// It is recommended practice to <b>always</b> immediately
	/// follow a call to <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.Lock()"/> with a <see lang="try"/> block, most
	/// typically in a before/after construction such as:
	/// 
	/// <code>
	/// class X {
	///		private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
	///		// ...
	/// 
	/// 	public void m() {
	/// 		lock.Lock();  // block until condition holds
	/// 		try {
	/// 			// ... method body
	/// 		} finally {
	/// 			lock.Unlock()
	/// 		}
	/// 	}
	/// }
	/// </code>
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// In addition to implementing the <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ILock"/> interface, this
	/// class defines methods <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.IsLocked"/> and
	/// <see cref="Spring.Threading.Locks.ReentrantLock.GetWaitQueueLength"/> , as well as some associated
	/// <see lang="protected"/> access methods that may be useful for
	/// instrumentation and monitoring.
	/// 
	/// <p/> 
	/// Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
	/// locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
	/// its state when serialized.
	/// 
	/// <p/> 
	/// This lock supports a maximum of 2147483648 recursive locks by
	/// the same thread.
